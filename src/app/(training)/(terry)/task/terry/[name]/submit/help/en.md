## What should I send?

To submit a solution, you have to send two files: the source file and the output file.

### Source file

The source file is the file containing the source code for the program you wrote. For example, if you are using C++ the source file will have the extension `.cpp`, if you are using Python the extension will be `.py`.

You have to send a single file containing all the code, you can't send configuration files, you can't send multiple files, and you can't send a ZIP file. 

You can use any programming language to solve the task.

### Output file

To generate the output file, you have to download the input using the "Download Input" button, then you have to run your program. Your program should read from the input file, and it should print an output with the following format:

```
Case #1: ...
Case #2: ...
Case #3: ...
...
```

Save it to a file and upload it as an output file.
